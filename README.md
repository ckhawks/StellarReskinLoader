# Stellar Reskin Loader
Puck clientside mod that allows users to change their textures at runtime, and create reskin packs that can be shared on the workshop with others.

## Features
- In game user interface in main menu and pause menu
- Saving and loading selected reskins into a profile
- Also allows users to toggle crowd, scoreboard, glass, and hanger visibility
- Allows reskinning or customizing:
  - Sticks (blue/red)
  - Ice & ice smoothness
  - Boards colors
  - Boards pillars color
  - Goal nets
  - Glass smoothness
  - Puck
  - Skybox
- Reload packs, textures, and profiles from in game for rapid iteration on textures

## Future
- Tooltips on hover, explaining what certain elements are
- Error detection when a workshop pack is missing for the current reskin profile
- Saving and loading multiple profiles
- Add reskin / customization for the following things:
  - Jerseys
  - Stick tapes
  - Garage door
  - Hanger roof
  - Goal frame colors
  - Goalie pads color + texture
  - Goalie helmets color + texture
  - Full arena swaps
- Server side syncing is a far future _maybe_

## Known Issues
- Personal stick skin does not show on yourself in replays
- Using the menu in the changing room does not bring focus to the player/stick properly (at all, currently)
